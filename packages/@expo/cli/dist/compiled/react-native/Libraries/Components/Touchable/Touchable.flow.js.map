It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\n\nconst States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER', // Not the responder\n  RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN: 'RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN', // Responder, inactive, in the `PressRect`\n  RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT: 'RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT', // Responder, inactive, out of `PressRect`\n  RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN: 'RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN', // Responder, active, in the `PressRect`\n  RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT: 'RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT', // Responder, active, out of `PressRect`\n  RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN: 'RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN', // Responder, active, in the `PressRect`, after long press threshold\n  RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT: 'RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT', // Responder, active, out of `PressRect`, after long press threshold\n  ERROR: 'ERROR',\n};\n\ntype State =\n  | typeof States.NOT_RESPONDER\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_OUT\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_OUT\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_IN\n  | typeof States.RESPONDER_ACTIVE_LONG_PRESS_OUT\n  | typeof States.ERROR;\n\n/**\n * By convention, methods prefixed with underscores are meant to be @private,\n * and not @protected.
