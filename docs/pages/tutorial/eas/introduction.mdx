description: An introduction to the tutorial for building apps for Android and iOS using Expo Application Services (EAS) that covers the Build, Update, and Submit workflows.
---

We're about to embark on a journey for building our mobile apps on the cloud. In this tutorial, we'll take our app built in the previous tutorial, create a development build and a preview version, and deploy it to the app stores.

## What will I learn in this tutorial

The objective of this tutorial is to get familiar with [Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) such as Build, Submit, and Update. The following topics are covered:

- Create and install a development build and run it on a device (or an emulator or a simulator) with EAS Build
- Learn about the benefits of a development build
- Set workflows to distribute a development build internally with a team or externally
- Manage different app versions
- Install multiple app variants (development and preview) on the same device
- Create and publish an update with EAS Update to iterate faster during development
- Learn how to handle environment variables and secrets with EAS
- Finally, trigger builds from a GitHub repository

These topics will give us a foundation to learn about the fundamentals of using different EAS services.

## How to use this tutorial

This tutorial emphasizes learning by doing. It is self-paced and can take up to two to three hours to complete. To follow along, you can use your own project if you have it already, or you can choose one of the following options:

- Use the Sticker Smash app from the previous tutorial. If you haven't followed the previous tutorial, download the complete source code from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/sticker-smash-expo-tutorial-app) and set the project on your local machine.
- Create a new project with `[npx create-expo-app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/)`
- Create and use a project generated by React Native CLI (also known as bare React Native project). It will contain the native directories (**android** and **ios**). You'll have to install the `expo` package (either [automatically](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) or [manually](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/#manual-installation)) in the project before you proceed.

## Tools that are optional but not required

It might come in handy to run the example app locally using either an Android Emulator or an iOS Simulator.

To install and setup these tools, take a look at the following guides:

- [Set up Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [Set up iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) (available only on macOS)

> **Note**: This is not a requirement to follow this tutorial since we are also going to run our apps on real devices. You can safely skip those steps where it uses an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

## Code

Although we are not going to interact with our project's code directly, we'll be focusing more on configuration and setup related files. Throughout the rest of the tutorial, an example config will be highlighted in yellow. You can hover over the highlights (on desktop) or tap them (on mobile) to see more context about the change.

## Next step

We're ready for this journey after setting up an Expo project locally.
