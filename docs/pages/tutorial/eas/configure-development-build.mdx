description: Create a new development build using EAS
---

In this chapter, we're going to learn about the setup required to configure a development build with EAS from our example app.

## Understanding development builds

Let's start by learning about what are development builds and why do we need them.

A development build is a debug version of our project. It is optimized for quick iterations when creating an app. Using Expo means including the `expo-dev-client` library, which offers a robust and complete development environment. This setup allows us to integrate any native library or change code inside the [native directories](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#android-and-ios-native-projects) as required.

> **Note:** If you are familiar with Expo Go, think of a development build as a customizable version of Expo Go that is unique to the requirements of a project.

## 1 Install expo-dev-client library

To initialize our project for a development build, let's navigate inside our project directory and install `expo-dev-client` library by running the following command:

```
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

### Start the development server

Run `npx expo start` to start the development server:

```
npx expo start
```

`npx expo start` starts your metro development server. In the terminal window, we see the familiar QR code followed by the `Metro waiting on...`:

Let's notice the changes installing `expo-dev-client` has done for us:

1. The manifest URL contains `expo-development-client` along with the app scheme
2. The development server now operates for a development build (instead of Expo Go).

Since we do not have a development build installed on one of our devices or an emulator/simulator, we can't run our project yet.

## Benefits of creating a development build

A development build offers several advantages. Here are some key highlights:

- During development, it helps iterate quickly to achieve a web-like iteration speed when developing a mobile app
- It allows sharing the native runtime with your team so that they can test features in development
- You can install any third-party library that requires custom native code or make changes to the native projects (if required)
- It allows the use of custom config plugins
- Provides a reduced bundled app size. A development client is not bundled with all libraries from Expo SDK. It only contains the libraries you add to the project. The `expo` package only adds 1 MB one time to the final app binary size and has a marginal size cost. For example, it adds only 150 Kib on Android. The rest comes from the language, such as Kotlin on Android.

## 2 Create a development build

We will use EAS Build, a hosted service for building app binaries, to create our first development build. This service is cloud-based and works for any React Native project.

### Install EAS CLI

To interact with EAS services, we need to install its Command Line Interface (CLI) tool called EAS CLI, as a global dependency in our development environment. Run the command:

```
npm install -g eas-cli
```

> Tip: You can also use the above command to check if a new version of EAS CLI is available and then update it. We encourage you to always stay up to date with the latest version.

### Log in or sign up Expo account

> If you have an Expo account and are signed in using Expo CLI, skip this step.

To log in, run the following command:

```
eas login
```

This command asks for our EAS email or username and password to complete the login.

> Tip: Using eas whoami we can always check whether we are logged in or not from our Expo account and from which account (in case we have multiple Expo accounts).

If you don't have an Expo account, [sign up here](https://expo.dev/signup) and proceed with the login command described above.

### Initialize and link the project to EAS

For any new project, the first step is to initialize and link it to the EAS servers. Run `eas init` command:

```
eas init
```

This command prompts us to verify the account owner (using our Expo account's credentials) and asks if we want to create a new EAS project:

![02-2.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb75e014-3067-4300-9385-30e46c46e728/ac0f477d-9642-4739-9e1b-56db998af93c/02-2.png)

On execution, `eas init` command:

- Creates EAS project and provides a link to that project (for example, [https://expo.dev/accounts/[acccount]/projects/[project-name]](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Bacccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject-name%5D)) which we can open in the Expo dashboard.

  ![02-3.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb75e014-3067-4300-9385-30e46c46e728/849f6b20-c4dc-4496-ab28-ebe98aabf21c/02-3.png)

- Creates a unique `projectId` and links the EAS project to the example app on our developer machine.
- Modifies **app.json** to add `[extra.eas.projectId](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/#easconfig)` and updates its value with the unique ID created in the above step. It also adds an `owner` property to the **app.json** file with our Expo account username.

### What is projectId in app.json

When `eas init` command runs, it associates a unique identifier for your project in **app.json** under `extra.eas.projectId`. It is used to identify our project on EAS servers.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ...
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "0cd3da2d-6148-4071-b6db-fdc55b17f274"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3 Configure a project for EAS Build

To set up our project for EAS Build, run the following command:

```
eas build:configure
```

This command:

- Prompts to select a platform: Android, iOS, or All. Since we are creating Android and iOS apps, let’s select **All**.

  ![02-4.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb75e014-3067-4300-9385-30e46c46e728/ec5f5375-8d2e-42df-ac13-bf1ba50a6356/02-4.png)

- Creates an **eas.json** file in the root of our project’s directory with the following default configuration:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 6.0.0"
  },

  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },

    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },

    "production": {}
  },

  "submit": {
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

In the above file, **eas.json** does two things:

- Defines the current EAS CLI version
- Adds three build profiles: `development`, `preview`, and `production`

This is the default configuration for **eas.json** file. In any project, when we run `eas build:configure` command for the first time, we will see this configuration.

### Exploring development profile

**eas.json** is a collection of build profiles where each profile has a specific configuration. Using the configuration, we can create a certain type of build (for example, development, preview, production, and so on). Each profile can also contain platform-specific (`android` or `ios`) properties for a build type.

Right now, we are interested in the `development` profile. This build profile is configured with the following properties:

- `developmentClient` that is set to `true` to create a debug build. It allows `expo-dev-client` library to load the app and provide tools to develop it. It also generates a build artifact we will install on a device or emulator/simulator.
- `distribution` that is set to `internal`. It makes the build ready for internal distribution.

> Note: Each build is customizable and can be configured further. You can add platform-specific options or extend one build profile's configuration in another. Learn more about [build profiles](https://docs.expo.dev/build/eas-json/#build-profiles).

## Summary
