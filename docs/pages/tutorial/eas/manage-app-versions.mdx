In this chapter, we're going to configure our app to auto-increment the developer-facing app version. Learning about it will be useful before we dive into production build in the next few chapters.

## Difference between developer-facing and user-facing app versions

An app version is composed of two values:

- The `versionCode` for Android and `buildNumber` for iOS (also known as developer-facing values)
- The [`version`](/versions/latest/config/app/#version) property in **app.json** (also known as user-facing values)

## Manually manage developer-facing values

Google Play Store and Apple App Store use developer-facing values to identify each unique build. Submitting builds with duplicate version numbers will result in errors, necessitating a rebuild with a new version number.

To manage app versions, `android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber` can be set in **app.config.js** and manually updated for each new production release:

```json app.config.js
{
  "ios": {
    "buildNumber": "1"
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
  },
  "android": {
    "versionCode": "1"
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

However, we are not going to set them up manually. We are going to use EAS Build to automate this process in the next section.

> **Note**: The user-facing version number is not handled by EAS. Instead, we define that in the app store developer portals before submitting our production app for review.

## Automate app version management with EAS Build

EAS Build can assist us in automating these values by utilizing the [Remote version resource](/build-reference/app-versions/#remote-version-source). This feature automatically increments developer-facing values and keeps track of them whenever a new production release is made.

In **eas.json**:

- Add `cli.appVersionSource` and set it to `remote`
- Set `build.production.autoIncrement` to `true`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
    /* @info Add the appVersionSource property and set it to remote*/
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
    /* @end */
  },
  "build": {
    "production": {
      /* @info Set the autoIncrement property to true to automatically increment the versionCode or buildNumber */
      "autoIncrement": true
      /* @end */
    }
  }
  /* @hide ... */ /* @end */
}
```

When we create a new production build in the next chapter, the `versionCode` or `buildNumber` will increment automatically (we'll see this in practice in the next chapter).

## Summary

In this chapter, we:

- Learned the difference between developer-facing (`android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber`) and user-facing (`version`) app version values.
- Identified the importance of unique app versions to avoid app store rejections.
- Updated **eas.json** to automatically increment developer-facing versions for production builds, using a remote version source for developer convenience.
