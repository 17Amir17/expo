title: Text Encoding
description: An API reference for the TextEncoder and TextDecoder built-in APIs
---

The Expo runtime for iOS and Android includes whatwg spec-compliant, native implementations of [`TextDecoder`](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#textdecoder) and [`TextEncoder`](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#textencoder).

JavaScript polyfills for `TextDecoder` and `TextEncoder` can be very heavy and should be avoided if possible. The native built-ins reuse the native platform encoding/decoding implementations and are much more performant.

## Usage

```js
// TextEncoder and TextDecoder are globally available and do not need to be imported.
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

// Prints "Hello Expo"
console.log(decoder.decode(encoder.encode('Hello Expo')));
```

## Supported Encodings

https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding

While `utf-8` is the only non-legacy encoding method left, we additionally support the native encoding formats of the underlying platforms.

### iOS

[All encodings](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding) in the specification are supported.

### Android

TBD

### Web

Refer to the [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=TextEncoder) page to see which encodings are supported on which web browsers.

### Server

Refer to the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#class-utiltextdecoder) to see which encodings are supported on the server.
