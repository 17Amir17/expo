import { Tabs, Tab } from '~/ui/components/Tabs';
import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

When a file is created in the **app** directory, it automatically becomes a route in the app. For example, the following files will create the following routes:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['app/index.js', "matches '/'"],
    ['app/home.js', "matches '/home'"],
    ['app/[user].js', "matches dynamic paths like '/expo' or '/evanbacon'"],
    ['app/settings/index.js', "matches '/settings'"],
  ]}
/>

## Pages

Pages are defined by exporting a React component as the default value from a file in the **app** directory. The file they are exported from must use one of the `.js`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.ts` extensions.

For example, create the **app** directory in your project and then create a file **index.js** inside it. Then, add the following snippet:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Universal">

    Render text on any platform with the `<Text>` component from React Native.

    ```jsx app/index.js
    import { Text } from 'react-native';

    export default function Page() {
      return <Text>Home page</Text>;
    }
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab label="Web-only">

    Alternatively, you can write web-only React components such as `<div>`, `<p>`, and so on. However, these won't render on native platforms.

    ```jsx app/index.js
    export default function Page() {
      return <p>Home page</p>;
    }
    ```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The above example matches the `/` route in the app and the browser. Files named **index** match the parent directory and do not add a path segment. For example, **app/settings/index.js** matches `/settings` in the app.

> Platform extensions (for example, **.ios.js**, **.native.ts**) are not supported in the **app** directory. See [Platform-specific modules](/router/advanced/platform-specific-modules), for more information.

## Dynamic routes

Dynamic routes match any unmatched path at a given segment level.

| Route                     | Matched URL          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **app/blog/[slug].js**    | `/blog/123`          |
| **app/blog/[...rest].js** | `/blog/123/settings` |

Routes with higher specificity will be matched before a dynamic route. For example, `/blog/bacon` will match **blog/bacon.js** before **blog/[id].js**.

Multiple slugs can be matched in a single route by using the rest syntax (`...`). For example, **app/blog/[...id].js** matches `/blog/123/settings`.

Dynamic segments are accessible as [search parameters](/router/reference/search-parameters) in the page component.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx app/blog/[slug].js
/* @info Import the <b>useLocalSearchParams</b> React hook */
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
/* @end */
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Page() {
  /* @info Access the query parameter named <b>slug</b> */
  const { slug } = useLocalSearchParams();
  /* @end */

  return <Text>Blog post: {slug}</Text>;
}
```

## Understanding page resolution

If there are multiple groups, a single URL can correspond to multiple pages. When navigating to a URL, the displayed page is chosen based on the following criteria:

1. **State**: The state of the current route. For example, whether the route is inside the same group.
2. **Specificity**: The number of segments in the route path. For example, `/` has a specificity of 1, `/blog` has a specificity of 2, and `/blog/[slug]` has a specificity of 3. The route with the highest specificity is chosen.
3. **Order**: The alphabetical order in which the pages are defined in the file system. For example, `/blog/[slug]` will be matched before `/blog/[...rest]`

If you ever recieve an error that a page is impossible to navigate to, it is because another route with a higher specificity and/or order will always be choosen before it.

### State

Your current route state are the groups that the route is inside. For example, if you are on the `/(app)/blog` route, the state is `['(app)']`. If you are on the `/(app)/(tabs)/settings` route, the state is `['(app)', '(tabs)']`.

When moving from one route to another, the state is preserved. For example, if you are on the `/(app)/blog` route and navigate to the `/(app,tabs)/settings` route, the state is preserved as `['(app)']`. If the next route has a different set of groups, the state is updated to match the new set of groups. For example, if you are on the `/(app)/blog` route and navigate to the `/(tabs)/settings` route, the state is updated to `['(tabs)']`.
You can explicitly set the state of the next route by including the groups within the URL. For example, `<Link href="/(tabs)/settings" />` will always set the state to `['(tabs)']`. You don't need to include all the groups in the URL, only the ones that you want to set.

Understanding the state is important is navigating multiple times. Consider the following file structure:

<FileTree
  files={[
    ['(public)/index.tsx'],
    ['(public,private)/news.tsx'],
    ['(public)/user.tsx'],
    ['(private)/user.tsx'],
    ['(private)/dashboard.tsx'],
  ]}
/>

If current route is `/` (the `/(public)/index.tsx` page) and the user navigates to `/news`, the displayed page is `/(public,private)/news.tsx` and state is `['(public)']`. When the user navigates to `/user`, the displayed page `/(public)/user` route, as the state was preserve as `['(public)']. Only when user explicitly navigates to `/(private)/user`or to `/(private)/dashboard` will the state be updated to`['(private)']`.

### Specificity

The specificity of a route is the number of segments in the route path. For example, `/` has a specificity of 1, `/blog` has a specificity of 2, and `/blog/[slug]` has a specificity of 3.

When a route is matched, the route with the highest specificity is chosen.

Examples:

- `/(app)/[...pages].tsx` and `/(app)/user/[...pages].tsx`, the latter is chosen because it has a higher specificity
- `/(app)/blog.tsx` and `/(app)/(nested)/[page].tsx`, `/(app)/blog.tsx` will cause a compiler error because its impossible to navigate to. The latter has a higher specificity and will always be chosen.
- `/(app)/index` and `/index.tsx`, `index.tsx` will cause a compiler error because its impossible to navigate to. The former has a higher specificity and will always be chosen.

### Order

When two routes have the same specificity, the route that is choosen by filename ordering. Static routes are always chosen before dynamic routes, otherwise they are chosen by alphabetical order.

Examples:

- `/(app)/blog.tsx` and `/(app)/[slug].tsx`, `/(app)/blog.tsx` is chosen because it is static
- `/(tabs)/user.tsx` and `/(app)/user.tsx`, `/(app)/user.tsx` is chosen becausethe `(app)` group is alphabetically first
- `/(app)/[page].tsx` and `/(app)/[slug].tsx`, `/(app)/[slug].tsx` will cause a compiler error as it is impossible to navigate to.
