title: Static Assets
description: Learn how to serve static assets with the public directory in your Expo Router project.

import { FileTree } from '~/ui/components/FileTree';

import { Terminal } from '~/ui/components/Snippet';

> The public directory is _currently_ web-only.

Expo CLI serves static assets from the root **public** directory. You can use this directory to serve images, fonts, and other static assets.

<FileTree
  files={[
    'app/index.js',
    'public/favicon.ico',
    'public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association',
    'public/banner.jpg',
    'package.json',
  ]}
/>

These files can be accessed from the dev server by matching the file name. For example, the **banner.jpg** file can be accessed at **http://localhost:8081/favicon.ico** during **npx expo start**.

```js app/index.js
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Image
      source={{
        /* @info The <b>/</b> prefix is only available on web. */
        uri: '/banner.jpg',
        /* @end */
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

When exporting your project, the files from the **public** directory will be copied to the **dist** directory.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo export -p web']} />

This would result in the following files being copied to the **dist** directory.

<FileTree
  files={[
    'dist/index.html',
    'dist/favicon.ico',
    'dist/.well-known/apple-app-site-association',
    'dist/banner.jpg',
    'dist/_expo/static/js/web/entry-xxxx.js',
  ]}
/>

**Notes**:

- Avoid having conflicts between the **public** directory and the routes in the **app** directory.
- The **public** directory can technically be used in native, however the website must be deployed to a server for the assets to be accessible. These assets will load remotely and not be bundled with the app.
