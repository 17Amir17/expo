Whether you have built a native app using EAS Build or locally, the next step in your app development journey is to release a preview version of your app so that you can share it with your testing team. Sharing a preview version of your app allows anyone to test your app on a device or run it on multiple test devices. It also allows them to experience how the app is used in production.

This page outlines different strategies you can adopt to share a preview version of your app.

## Internal distribution

Internal distribution is a strategy where an app is shared with a limited audience. It is typically used for testing purposes within a team or organization or a selected group of testers.

Android and iOS both offer different ways to install a build of your application directly on a device (Google Play beta track or TestFlight). To share your application to Android devices, you have to build a **.apk** which can be directly installed on an Android device.

For iOS, apple provides ad hoc provisioning profile to distribute your app to test devices once they have been registered to your Apple Developer account.

Creating an internal distribution build with EAS helps you providing shareable URLs for your builds with instructions for your team to get it up and running.

## Using EAS Update with development builds

For a robust and flexible solution especially when you are planning to deploy your app to production, development builds are highly recommended. They provide a comprehensive development environment that can be further configured to generate previews for your app during the review stage.

Even though Expo Go is an open-source sandbox that can be good for previewing isolated prototypes on Android and iOS, it is not intended for production apps and should be avoided during the preview process of your app.

You can use a development build with EAS Update and see the getting started guide for further instructions to set up the `expo-updates` library and learn how to create a link between a build and an update.

EAS Update allows you to push updates so that you can iterate faster with your team. You can publish a new update for your team to preview. This process will allow any team member or reviewer with a registered device to review the latest version of your app by scanning a QR code.

If you have `expo-dev-client` library installed in your project, your team can launch different versions of your app and preview a published update inside the development build. It supports loading published EAS updates through channels.
